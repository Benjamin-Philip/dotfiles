* The What?

This repository has all my dotfiles for programs such as emacs, zsh, git and
more!

* The Why?

Till now I've not had my dotfiles (except my emacs config) under version
control. I've come to the conclusion that dotfiles are very easy to break, and
so have decided to put them under git. Plus it easier to migrate a different
computer now!

* The Ugly (i.e. the How?)

The dotfiles are managed with the help of GNU Stow.
