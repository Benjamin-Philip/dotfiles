#+title: XMonad config
* What?

This directory contains my xmonad config.

* Setup

First you will need a working installation of ghc and stack, preferably installed with
ghcup. You will then need to install all the devel dependencies for [[https://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html#dependencies][xmonad and
xmonad-contrib]], as well as for [[https://codeberg.org/xmobar/xmobar/src/branch/master/doc/compiling.org][xmobar]], since we will be compiling both from source (not
exactly from source, but from Hackage).

You then just need to run ~stack install~ and you should be ready to go!
